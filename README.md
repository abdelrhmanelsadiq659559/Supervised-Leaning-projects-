## Regression with a Crab Age Dataset
### Problem Statement
The problem statement for this project can be found on Kaggle.

### Solution
1. Start by loading and cleaning the dataset. Fortunately, the data was already clean, and I only needed to convert the categorical 'SEX' column into a numerical format.
2. Standardize the feature 'X' using a standard scaler.
3. Visualize the feature-age relationship to gain insights.
4. Discover key insights, such as a quadratic relationship between height and age, and more.
5. Implement the Ridge model (Regularized linear regression using L2).
6. Use the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) as the cost function, as required by Kaggle. Achieved a test score of approximately 1.47567.

### Access

## Binary Classification with a Software Defects Dataset

### Problem Statement
The problem statement for this project can be found on Kaggle.

### Solution
1. Start by loading and cleaning the dataset.
2. Standardize the feature 'X' using a standard scaler.
3. Implement the Regularized Logistic Regression model using L2 regularization.
4. Use the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) as the cost function, as required by Kaggle. Achieved a test score of approximately 0.78057, with a slight difference of about 0.01 from the first project on the leaderboard.

### Problem Faced
I encountered challenges in visualizing the data effectively, which limited my ability to gain insights and perform feature engineering.

### Access
